  * **üîí Secure Authentication**: User sign-up, sign-in, and Google OAuth are handled securely by **Supabase**.

## üèóÔ∏è System Architecture

JobCore is built with a modern, containerized architecture, making it scalable and easy to manage. All services are orchestrated via Docker Compose.

## üöÄ Getting Started

This project is fully containerized with Docker, making setup straightforward.

### Prerequisites

  * Docker Engine 20.10+
  * Docker Compose v2.0+

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/JobCore.git
    cd JobCore
    ```

2.  **Configure Environment Variables:**
    Create a `.env` file by copying the example file.

    ```bash
    cp env.example .env
    ```

    Now, open the `.env` file and add your credentials for **Supabase** and **OpenAI**. The other services are configured to work locally within Docker.

3.  **Start all services:**
    Run the following command to build and start all containers in detached mode.

    ```bash
    docker-compose up -d
    ```

4.  **Initialize Typesense:**
    After the containers are running, you need to initialize the Typesense collection and index the existing jobs from the database.

    ```bash
    # Step 1: Initialize the 'jobs' collection
    curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/jobs/typesense/init

    # Step 2: Bulk-index all jobs from MongoDB into Typesense
    curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/jobs/typesense/bulk-index
    ```
